# Project Submission Package

## Project Title
**AI Chief of Staff for Organizational Intelligence**

---

## Project Description (300 Words)

The AI Chief of Staff is a superhuman organizational intelligence platform that transforms raw email communications into actionable insights through advanced AI reasoning and interactive visualization. The system processes email data from CSV files, parses complex email structures using Python's email library, and converts them into structured JSON format. This data is then ingested into a Neo4j graph database, creating a comprehensive knowledge graph that maps communication relationships, patterns, and organizational dynamics.

At its core, the platform employs three specialized AI agents working in concert: the Memory Agent maintains versioned knowledge bases and tracks organizational changes over time; the Critic Agent detects conflicting decisions, duplicated topics, and communication overload; and the Coordinator Agent identifies relevant stakeholders and determines information routing through the organization. These agents use OpenAI's GPT-4o-mini model to reason over the communication data, providing intelligent summaries like "What Changed Today?" and stakeholder relevance analysis.

The system features a modern web interface built with Flask and vis-network, offering four key interaction modes: natural language querying with voice input support, interactive network graph visualization showing communication relationships, organizational insights dashboard, and real-time agent reasoning displays with visual communication flows. The Neo4j graph database enables complex relationship queries, allowing users to explore communication networks, identify key influencers, and understand information flow patterns.

Users can ask questions in natural language such as "Who are the top communicators?" or "What topics are discussed most frequently?" and receive AI-powered responses backed by relevant email context. The platform handles edge cases gracefully, includes comprehensive input validation, prevents XSS vulnerabilities, and provides detailed error handling throughout the system. With its agentic reasoning layer, conflict detection capabilities, and interactive visualizations, the AI Chief of Staff serves as a complete organizational intelligence system that helps teams understand their communication patterns and make data-driven decisions.
